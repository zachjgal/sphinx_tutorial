# Why this exists

For the project I've been working on as a co-op, I learned how to use the sphinx tool to automatically generate documentation/a reference page from the docstrings in the project's modules. As one of the only people in the office with much experience doing this, I was asked to throw together a brief, very informal slideshow about how to get sphinx autodocumentation up and running on a new project. It obviously doesn't scratch the surface of all the capabilities sphinx has, but that's not the point.

After finishing the slideshow, I put the example project I wrote for the slideshow here, so that people could interact with it if they wanted.
